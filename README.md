# HelloWorld
This is my first Program in Github.

As part of this exercise, I learned to create an Issue on a repository. 
I made the branch of my own and fixed the issue.
Also i will be learning the merge of the branch and closing the issue.

This the good exercise to start with GitHub. Hurray, I am learning :)
